what is class?
A. a class is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects and implementation of behaviors.
What is object?
A. An object is an instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. Application entry points are used to control users' access to different versions of an application that is deployed on a platform.

Why main is static?
A. To avoid ambiguity.

Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. The object class.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A.Path is an environment variable which is used by the operating system to find the executables.
Classpath is an environment variable which is used by the Java compiler to find the path

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A.The methods in an interface are implicitly abstract and can have implementation.
 An abstract class can  have instance methods that implements a behavior.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. You declare the object but don't implement it.

what is Access Specifier?
A.regulate access to classes, fields and methods
What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming.
    Inheritance = subclasses inherit methods and variables  from parent class.
    Encapsulation = data hiding
    Abstraction = abstract classes contain abstract methods that are declared and not implemented.
    Polymorphism = Overloading and overriding of method calls.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces.
    Java.lang is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A.Application Programming Interface. Javascript.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A.To avoid ambiguity error java does not support multiple inheritance through class.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A.Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. Exceptions are possible errors that can be handled by the programmer using try & catch blocks.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. static means it can be shared by all instances in a class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. final is used in methods and variables to not allow them to change.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final class can't be inherited, final method can't be overridden. Finally is used to place important code, executes regardless of exception handling.
Finalize is used to perform clean up processing just before object iis garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A. A block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. The default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. refers to the current object.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. It is used inside a sub-class method definition to call a method defined in the super class.

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
A.Yes

What version of java are you using?
A. version 8.

What is JAR stand for ?
A.Java Runtime Environment

What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. JVM is part of JDK that is used in the compiling process.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A.JRE is the implementation of JVM

What is compile time and run time?
A. When a program is processed during compiling vs when it is processed during running.

What is heap?
A. the runtime data area from which memory for all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
A.Using data structures like stack.

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A.StringBuffer is mutable means one can change the value of the object . The object created through StringBuffer is stored in the heap.
StringBuffer has the same methods as the StringBuilder , but each method in StringBuffer is synchronized that is StringBuffer is thread safe .

What is Singleton class?
A. A class that can have only one object.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A.Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream.
 Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
A. transient keyword is used on class attributes/variables to indicate that serialization process of such class
 should ignore such variables while creating a persistent byte stream for any instance of that class.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. in while, the condition comes first. in do while condition is at the end.

What is Enum?
A. Classes that share similar goal being merged by one outer class.

What is Iterator?
A. A way to traverse data.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A.Integer.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A. because String objects are cached in String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. he process of calling one constructor from another

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A.A serial collector is a default copying collector which uses only one GC thread for the GC operation,
while a parallel collector uses multiple GC threads for the GC operation.

What is JIT stands for?
A.Just In time

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A.When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects
For example Java methods, thread stacks and native handles are allocated in memory separate from the heap, as well as JVM internal data structures.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A.No.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. Heap memory is used by all the parts of the application whereas stack memory is used only by one thread of execution

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A.Reflection is an API which is used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, interfaces at runtime

what is multithreading in java?
A.The process of executing multiple threads simultaneously is known as multithreading.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A.Synchronized keyword in Java is used to provide mutually exclusive access to a shared resource with multiple threads in Java

What is Framework?
A.an abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by
additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. testNG, Junit, etc.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier

What are the dependencies for this project?
A.mySQL, mongoDB, testNG, Junit.

what is dependency injection in java?
A.  To create an instance of the class and inject the objects into the defined dependencies
What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A.Static binding in Java is the binding that occurs during compile time while dynamic binding occurs during runtime.
